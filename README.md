### Project Description

### Steps Involved
1. Dataset Examination:
	 - Get the dataset from the source and read it.
     - View the first few rows of the dataset.
     - Analyze the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
     - Let's check the data types of each column and look at general information about the data.
	 - Examining the general statistical information of the data we work with.

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

	 - Using a pie chart and bar chart, let's visualize the ranges in which the wine qualities scores are distributed.
	 - Examine the relationship between the target variable quality and other variables.
	 - Examine the relationship of all variables with each other with the heat map.
	 - Visualize the relationship between the variables that we think are most related to each other with regression graphs.
	 - Let's examine the density charts and box plots according to the scores given to the wines. Check it out.
